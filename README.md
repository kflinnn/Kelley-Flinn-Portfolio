# UCF Coding Bootcamp Challenge One

## Purpose

As a bootcamp student, I want to display my work on an easily accessed site for future employers. I was not provided any HTML or CSS, but started completely from scratch.

Using advanced CSS techniques, I organized my site in a way that is easy to navigate, but also nice to look at. I used flex boxes, psuedo classes, media queries, and many other skills to complete this. 

## Examples

Psuedo Class:
